# Basic Greedy Algo Design
>> - Greedy Choice Property  
  Find the first-step towards the optimum solution.
>> - Optimum Substructure Property  
Once the first-step is taken, then re-state the rest of the problem as a smaller version of the original problem.
Recursion  
>> - Recurse the first two step.
