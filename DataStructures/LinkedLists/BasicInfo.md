# Linked List
>>A linked list is a sequence of data structures, which are connected together via links.

> Linked List is a sequence of structures which contains items. Each structure contains a connection to another structure. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.

- Linked List is shown by a single structure element called head.

- Each structure carries a data field(s) and a link to another structure  called next.

- Last structure carries a link as null to mark the end of the list.

> There are three types of linked lists:
- Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

- Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

- Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.
