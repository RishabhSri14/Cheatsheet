# AVL Trees
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes.

This data structure is basically used to maintain height of the treee O(log n).  

> New node representation:<pre>
struct Node
{
    int key;
    struct Node *left;
    struct Node *right;
    int height;
};</pre>


Basic rotation operation are:
<pre>
T1, T2 and T3 are subtrees of the tree 
rooted with y (on the left side) or x (on 
the right side)           
     y                               x
    / \     Right Rotation          /  \
   x   T3   - - - - - - - >        T1   y 
  / \       < - - - - - - -            / \
 T1  T2     Left Rotation            T2  T3
Keys in both of the above trees follow the 
following order 
 keys(T1) < key(x) < keys(T2) < key(y) < keys(T3)
So BST property is not violated anywhere.

>> Insertion:  
1) Perform standard BST insert for w. 
2) Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path from w to z and x be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z. 
3) Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:   
a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)   
b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)   
c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)   
d) y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)  

<pre>
a) Left Left Case 

T1, T2, T3 and T4 are subtrees.
         z                                      y 
        / \                                   /   \
       y   T4      Right Rotate (z)          x      z
      / \          - - - - - - - - ->      /  \    /  \ 
     x   T3                               T1  T2  T3  T4
    / \
  T1   T2
b) Left Right Case 

     z                               z                           x
    / \                            /   \                        /  \ 
   y   T4  Left Rotate (y)        x    T4  Right Rotate(z)    y      z
  / \      - - - - - - - - ->    /  \      - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
T1   x                          y    T3                    T1  T2 T3  T4
    / \                        / \
  T2   T3                    T1   T2
c) Right Right Case 

  z                                y
 /  \                            /   \ 
T1   y     Left Rotate(z)       z      x
    /  \   - - - - - - - ->    / \    / \
   T2   x                     T1  T2 T3  T4
       / \
     T3  T4
d) Right Left Case 

   z                            z                            x
  / \                          / \                          /  \ 
T1   y   Right Rotate (y)    T1   x      Left Rotate(z)   z      y
    / \  - - - - - - - - ->     /  \   - - - - - - - ->  / \    / \
   x   T4                      T2   y                  T1  T2  T3  T4
  / \                              /  \
T2   T3
