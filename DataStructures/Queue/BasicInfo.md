# Queue

> Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks.  
Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends.  
One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue).  
Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

> This can be imagined as a narrow parking lot where the first car that enters has to leave first.

> This can be implemented by both array or linked lists.
