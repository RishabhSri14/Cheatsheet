# Stack
> Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).  

> It can be imagined as a one mouth open letter box in which letters are being place in and out from the opened end.
  
> It is easily implemented using simple array using arr[0] as closed end.
